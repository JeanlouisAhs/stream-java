## Java Streams: Exploration and Learning
This repository focuses on streams, a powerful 
feature introduced with Java 8. Streams allow for processing sequences 
of elements (like collections or arrays) in an expressive and fluid manner,
embracing a functional approach.

## Concept 
Streams operate on a data source (like a collection) and can 
execute a series of intermediate operations that transform the data before 
culminating in a terminal operation that produces a result or side effect.

Key takeaways about streams are:
* They do not modify the original data source.
* Intermediate operations are only executed when a terminal operation is invoked.
* A stream is designed to be used only once.
* Streams can be sequential or parallel.
